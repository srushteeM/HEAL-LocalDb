          Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique such
          as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought,
          or activity to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally
          clear and emotionally calm and stable state. Meditation is practiced
          in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation
          (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a salient
          role in the contemplative repertoire of Jainism, Buddhism and
          Hinduism.[5] Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have
          spread to other cultures where they have also found application in
          non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health. Meditation may
          significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and
          enhance peace, perception,self-concept, and well-being. Research is
          ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health
          (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
